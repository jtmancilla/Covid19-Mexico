## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Download and Install Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.7.3. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Covid19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE from to better understand:

1. Can we guess Mexico Covid-19 cases for the next 10 days?
2. How look some countries at the same Mexico period?
3. What countries have the highest correlations Mexico trend with?
4. The forecast to Mexico for the next 10 days


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jt.mancilla/can-we-guess-mexico-covid-19-confirme-cases-for-the-next-10-days-896fd12aa17).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
